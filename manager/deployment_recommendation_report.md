### Model Selection and Deployment Report

#### Model Selection Based on Current System Report

Given the specifications of the system, including CPU, memory, and storage capabilities, the following models are recommended for deployment:

1. **LLaMA 7B Model:**
   - **Reasoning**: The system's hardware, with 8 CPU cores and 15GiB of RAM, supports the inference of smaller models efficiently. The LLaMA 7B model quantized to 4-bit can run at approximately 7.3 tokens per second using optimized threading on available CPUs.
   - **Deployment Fit**: This model is suitable for applications where quick responses and low computational resources are necessary, such as chatbots or intelligent query systems.

2. **LLaMA 13B Model:**
   - **Reasoning**: While the system can handle this model, performance may be limited compared to the 7B model. With quantization, the 13B model can achieve around 5.2 tokens per second at best. It still represents a feasible option if the application calls for more advanced capabilities but expects somewhat slower performance.
   - **Deployment Fit**: Use this model for scenarios requiring somewhat more complexity in document generation or summarization tasks.

3. **Avoid Large Models (e.g., LLaMA 30B and Beyond)**:
   - **Reasoning**: Given the processed information and RAM limitations, larger models like the 30B version are not recommended due to significantly slower inference speeds and increased memory requirements which the current system cannot support well.
   - **Deployment Fit**: These models would be impractical for deployment in the current configuration.

The inference performance of the recommended models on the existing architecture also aligns closely with the capabilities indicated in the CPU Inference Guide.

#### Deployment Environment Considerations

- **CPU Performance**: The absence of a dedicated GPU limits the deployment to CPU-based inference tasks. While they can handle small to medium-sized models efficiently, any large-scale training or inference requiring significant GPU resources is impractical under the current setup.
  
- **RAM and Storage**: The 15GiB of RAM is adequate for medium-scale workloads, but incoming workloads or model complexities should be monitored to prevent resource exhaustion, particularly since only 8.2GiB of storage is available.

- **Utilization of Threading**: The system can leverage its 8 cores optimally; hence, efficient threading configurations are crucial during model inference.

#### Recommended Deployment Strategy

1. **Environment Setup**: Install necessary libraries and frameworks that support model inference, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Ensure that the quantized versions of the selected models are utilized for optimal performance.

2. **Testing and Monitoring**: Deploy the LLaMA 7B model first in a test environment. Monitor the system's CPU and memory usage, model response times, and overall performance under expected loads. Adjust threading and memory configurations based on observations.

3. **Scaling Considerations**: If demand grows or if the complexity of tasks increases, consider migrating to a dedicated GPU environment, possibly leveraging cloud-based solutions or upgrading to a more robust infrastructure with adequate GPU resources for LLaMA 13B or beyond.

4. **Long-Term Strategy**: Explore the procured GPUs or hardware solutions that can be integrated into existing systems to enhance the model deployment capabilities for future needs without hampering immediate operational efficiency.

#### Summary

The virtual machine setup is only capable of efficiently using smaller models due to the absence of a dedicated GPU and limited RAM. The LLaMA 7B model offers a feasible deployment point with reliable performance for various applications, while considerations for future upgrades should be made to facilitate broader model utilization if needs expand.
